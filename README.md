# nesigner

A hardware ESP32 Nostr Signer.

## Overview

**nesigner** is an ESP32-based application designed to sign and process Nostr messages. It leverages USB interfaces to receive, process, and respond to messages. The project is built using ESP-IDF and integrates with components like TinyUSB for USB connectivity.

## You must know

- The project has implemented the Nostr Signer functionality.
- The project is still under development and we may modify all the code.
- Many code is generated by multiple AIs.

## Features

- Nostr Signer Basic Methods: ```getPublicKey```, ```signEvent```, ```nip04.encrypt```, ```nip04.decrypt```, ```nip44_encrypt``` and ```nip44_decrypt```.
- The private key is only stored in the board, and all operations are performed in the board.
- One Pin code corresponds to one private key.
- Multiple sets of private keys can be stored.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF installed and configured.
- Supported ESP32 board.
- Basic knowledge of embedded C programming.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository and init git submodule:

```
git clone https://github.com/haorendashu/nesigner.git
git submodule init;
git submodule update;
```

2. Set up the ESP-IDF environment.

3. Config permission if necessary.

**Linux**, create ```/etc/udev/rules.d/99-nesigner.rules```:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTR{idVendor}=="0x2323", ATTR{idProduct}=="0x3434", MODE="0666"
```

or

```
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", MODE="0666"
```

reload rule:

```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

~~**Windows**, use [Zadig Tool](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to install WinUSB Driver.~~


4. Configure the project:

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

5. Build, flash, and monitor the project:

```
idf.py build flash monitor
```
